# Timelapse Project

This project contains scripts and resources for creating and analyzing timelapse videos, primarily focusing on plant growth and sourdough starter volume changes. The project uses a Raspberry Pi (Zero 2 W) and Arduino Uno for capturing and processing data, alongside Python scripts for analysis and visualization.

---

## Project Overview
The `timelapse-project` repository supports:
- **Image Capture:** Automated photo capture with the Raspberry Pi and data logging (e.g., temperature and humidity).
- **Image Processing:** Detection and analysis of features such as bubbles in liquids and changes in volume.
- **Timelapse Video Creation:** Combining captured images into videos with graphical overlays.
- **Data Analysis:** Plotting metrics like temperature, humidity, and bubble count over time.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

```
timelapse-project/
├── scripts/                  # Python scripts for image processing and timelapse creation
│   ├── bubbles_and_height.py       # Script for measuring starter height and counting bubbles
│   ├── timelapse_animation.py      # Script to create timelapse videos with overlays
│   ├── timelapse_capture_images_and_data.py  # Script to capture images and log data
├── images/                   # Directory containing raw example images
├── processed_images/         # Directory containing processed example images
├── data_log.csv              # Example temperature and humidity data
├── combined_starter_data.csv # Example combined output data
├── README.md                 # Project documentation (this file)
├── .gitignore                # File to exclude unnecessary items from the repository
```

## Installation
### Prerequisites
1. **Hardware:**
   - Raspberry Pi (Zero 2 W or similar)
   - Arduino Uno
   - Camera module (compatible with Raspberry Pi)

2. **Software:**
   - Python 3.7+
   - Git
   - Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gitpkj/timelapse-project.git
   cd timelapse-project
   ```

2. **Set Up the Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Hardware:**
   - Connect the camera module to the Raspberry Pi.
   - Ensure the Arduino is connected to the Raspberry Pi via USB.

## Usage
### Example Data
This repository includes example data for testing the scripts:
- **`images/`:** Contains a subset of raw images for testing.
- **`processed_images/`:** Contains processed images generated by the script.
- **`data_log.csv`:** Contains sample temperature and humidity data.
- **`combined_starter_data.csv`:** Combined data generated from the example images and logs.

Use these files to test the scripts without setting up your own environment.

### Running the Scripts
1. **Capture Images and Data:**
   Run `timelapse_capture_images_and_data.py` to capture images and log data:
   ```bash
   python scripts/timelapse_capture_images_and_data.py
   ```

2. **Analyze Starter Height and Bubbles:**
   Run `bubbles_and_height.py` to measure starter height and count bubbles:
   ```bash
   python scripts/bubbles_and_height.py
   ```

3. **Create a Timelapse Video:**
   Run `timelapse_animation.py` to create a timelapse video with graphical overlays:
   ```bash
   python scripts/timelapse_animation.py
   ```

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add your feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
5. Open a pull request.

## Known Issues
1. **Large Files:** Ensure `.tar.gz` and virtual environment files (`venv/`) are excluded from Git using `.gitignore`.
2. **Performance:** Processing large numbers of images may require sufficient memory and CPU resources.
